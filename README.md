# AMIC - Acoustic Monitoring in Chemnitz

**Acoustic monitoring in Chemnitz: From the city to the forest** -
BirdNET x Botanical Garden

As part of a project to investigate the influence of road noise on the
singing behavior of native birds, acoustic monitorung units are deployed
in the [Botanical Garden
Chemnitz](https://www.chemnitz.de/chemnitz/de/leben-in-chemnitz/freizeit/botanischer-garten/index.html).
Four [audio recorders from
OekoFor](https://oekofor.netlify.app/de/portfolio/ecopi-bird/) are set
up at different distances from the road.

The bird calls captured by these audio recorders are analyzed using
BirdNET, a collaborative initiative between Chemnitz University of
Technology and the K. Lisa Yang Center for Conservation Bioacoustics.
BirdNET identifies bird species while filtering out human-made sounds.
The results are available to the public on a [project
website](https://birdnet.tu-chemnitz.de/link/botanischergarten), where the
sounds of some of the recognized species can be heard. This repository
contains the code for the Shiny App, which powers the project website.

This project is a collaboration between the Chemnitz Botanical Garden,
Chemnitz University of Technology, and OekoFor.

## Website

```

## Funding

This project is supported by Jake Holshuh (Cornell class of ’69) and The
Arthur Vining Davis Foundations. Our work in the K. Lisa Yang Center for
Conservation Bioacoustics is made possible by the generosity of K. Lisa
Yang to advance innovative conservation technologies to inspire and
inform the conservation of wildlife and habitats.

The development of BirdNET is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research through the project “BirdNET+” (FKZ 01|S22072). The German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety contributes through the “DeepBirdDetect” project (FKZ 67KI31040E). In addition, the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt supports BirdNET through the project “RangerSound” (project 39263/01).

## Partners

BirdNET is a joint effort of partners from academia and industry.
Without these partnerships, this project would not have been possible.
Thank you!
